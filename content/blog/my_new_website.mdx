After a long time of procastinating, I've finally been able to make time to create my own personal website. This website involves a relatively
small tech stack and doesn't cost a dime as it involves no hosting or backend. In this post, I will like to share what the website is built on with you.

Here is a link to the site on Github: [Code](https://github.com/oluwakeye-john/personal). You can grab some codes and use it in yours.
Also, feel free to raise an issue.

## Tech Stack

### Gatsby

Gatsby is a static site generator (SSR) which is used to make blazing fast websites and it is based on React. Gatsby uses server-side rendering to create static websites.
Build usually take a while, which is based on the number of pages and images. I chose Gatsby for this project because it:

- Has great image optimization
- Has a large ecosystem of developers
- Is blazing fast

### Github

Both the code and the post content is stored on github.

### Styled Components

I used styled components for styling. I hope I will talk more about it in a future post. Styled components allow for true reusable components, locally scoped classes and prevents clashing class names.

### MDX

Most developers love markdown. So combining the power of markdown (md) and react JSX for a blog is absolutely incredible. It allows you to embed any react components especially stuffs like tweets and video players into your blog.

### ImprovMX

Improvx serves as my mailing server. Forwards mails from \*@keyejohn.com to my personal email account. Itâ€™s free.

### React-icons

It is a collection of icons: font-awesome, material design icons, etc. For this project, I used only font awesome though I hope to explore other ones in future.

### PrismJS

Prism is a lightweight, extensible syntax highlighter, built with modern web standards in mind.

### Netlify

This website is hosted on Netlify. I enabled continuous deployment, so that the code is automatically updated from Github

## Summary

This stack is in no way perfect. I however went with this because:

- It has great developer experience (DE)
- It is cheap (comes at no cost)
- It is very easy to maintain
